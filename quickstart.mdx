## Content hierarchy

- **Faculty** → **Year** → **Semester** → **Module** → **Exam/Bank**
- Every exam or MCQ bank lives under its module, so you always know the context.

## Filters

- Filter by module, topic, tags, or difficulty to narrow down to the exact questions you want.
- Save your preferred filters to return to the same view quickly.

## Tips

- Use search to jump directly to a module or bank name.
- Recently opened banks appear first so you can continue where you left off.
