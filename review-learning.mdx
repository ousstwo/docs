## Mistake review

- Access your past sessions to see which questions you missed and why.
- Corrections include explanations and links back to source material when available.
- Re-run a bank focusing only on missed questions to reinforce weak spots.

## Flagging questions

- If something looks off, flag the question for staff review.
- Include a short note so the team knows what to verify (answer key, wording, or scoring).
- You'll see a status update once staff has reviewed and updated the item.
