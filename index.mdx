title: "Introduction"
description: "A blank canvas for your product documentation"
---

Welcome! This project is prepped for your docs but ships with minimal placeholder copy. Swap in your own sections, screenshots, and code snippets to introduce your product.

## What's included

- A simple navigation defined in `docs.json`
- Placeholder pages for an overview, quickstart, and API reference
- A starter OpenAPI file you can replace to generate API docs automatically

## Start writing

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Quickstart" icon="rocket" href="/quickstart">
    Outline the first things a new user should do.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local preview" icon="pen-to-square" href="/development">
    Run the docs locally while you edit content.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Next steps

1. Update the site name, colors, navbar, and footer in `docs.json`.
2. Replace the text on these pages with product-specific guidance.
3. Remove any sections you don't need and add new `*.mdx` files as you grow.
