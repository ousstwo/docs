  **Prerequisites**
  - Node.js 18+
  - The Mintlify CLI installed globally (`npm i -g mint`)
</Info>

## Run the docs locally

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    From the root of this project (where `docs.json` lives), install packages if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the preview server">

```bash
mint dev
```

    Open `http://localhost:3000` to view the docs. Changes to `*.mdx` files hot reload automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Use a different port

If something else is running on port 3000, start the preview on another port:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

### Helpful checks

- `mint broken-links` to catch dead links before publishing
- `mint update` to make sure your CLI matches the latest runtime

## Tips while editing

- Keep navigation in sync with your pages by updating `navigation.tabs` in `docs.json`.
- Store images in `images/` and reference them with absolute paths like `/images/your-image.png`.
- Add short frontmatter (`title`, `description`) at the top of each MDX file to control page metadata.
